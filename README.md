# Proxima Dashboad

---

#### Monitor Proxima workers and tasks in a shmexy SvelteKit web app :sparkles:
If you don't know what Proxima is, it's a distributed proxy encoding application for DaVinci Resolve.
If that sounds good to you, [check it out](https://github.com/in03/proxima)!

> **Note**:
> 
> This is currently a (slow) work in progress. It's not highest on the agenda to complete
> compared to some of the other todos I have for Proxima, let alone my other projects.
> If there's interest, I'll reevaluate my priorities - especially if others are keen to get involved
> and contribute!



## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
